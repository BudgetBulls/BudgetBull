            Alex had always been good at saving money, but he struggled with sticking to a budget. He would create a plan for his finances, but as soon as he saw something he wanted, he would give in and overspend. Determined to change his ways, Alex did some research on how to stick to a budget.

            One strategy he found was to create a visual representation of his goals. Alex made a chart with his savings goals and hung it on his wall, so he could see it every day. Whenever he felt tempted to overspend, he looked at his chart and reminded himself of why he was budgeting in the first place. With this new strategy, Alex was able to stick to his budget and achieve his savings goals.</p></div>

        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">The buzz of the little world </span><p><span class="headline hl4">A thousand unknown plants</span></p></div><p>I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath</p></div>
        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">It wasn't a dream </span><p><span class="headline hl4">by Marcy Lab</span></p></div><p>Have you ever had one of those moments where everything felt like a dream? When you're not sure if what you're experiencing is real or just a figment of your imagination? I recently had an experience like this.

            I had been working hard towards a goal for months, and when the moment finally arrived, it felt surreal. The feeling was so intense that I thought I was dreaming. It was like the culmination of everything I had worked for was playing out before my eyes, and I was just a spectator in my own life.</p>
					
					<p> But as I slowly came to my senses, I realized that it wasn't a dream. It was real. I had achieved my goal, and the sense of accomplishment I felt was unlike anything else. It was a reminder that hard work, perseverance, and dedication can pay off in the end.

                        So if you ever find yourself in a situation where everything feels like a dream, take a step back, take a deep breath, and remind yourself that it's real. Embrace the moment, appreciate your hard work, and keep moving forward towards your next goal. </p></div>
